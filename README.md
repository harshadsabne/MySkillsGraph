# MySkillsGraph
Graph of my skills on a scale of 10 using AngularJS and ZingChart.</br>
(Disclaimer: For the time being, skills and ratings used are for representation purpose only and do not represent my actual skills/ratings.)

##Idea
A very common question asked during tech interviews is "How would you rate your skills on a scale of 10?" And if it is a telephonic interview, rating all of them can be time consuming.
Hence MySkillsGraph. Keep it ready and share when asked.

##Why AngularJS and not plain old HTML?
Simply because I was asked - "How would you rate your AngularJS skills.." ;-)</br>
I can use this as a starter template for future AngularJS-ZingChart projects.

##How to use
1) Edit index.js and rename/add your own skills.</br>
2) Open index.html in any browser.</br>

You can embed it in your online resume or even download it as PNG/PDF/SVG. ZingChart is pretty cool and renders great charts in less effort.
